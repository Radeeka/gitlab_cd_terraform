## Overview

This GitLab CI/CD pipeline automates the provisioning and management of AWS EKS clusters using Terraform. It offers the following features:

1. **GitLab Managed Terraform**: Utilizes GitLab's built-in Terraform integration for secure and version-controlled infrastructure management.

2. **Secure Terraform State Storage**: Leverages GitLab's HTTP backend for Terraform to securely store the state file.

3. **Terraform Plan and Apply**: The pipeline includes a build stage for generating Terraform plans and a deploy stage for applying those plans to create or update EKS clusters.

4. **Multi-Environment Deployment**: The pipeline can deploy to multiple environments, such as test and production, thanks to the use of pipeline schedule variables.

5. **Configuration in .gitlab-ci.yml**: Everything related to the CI/CD pipeline is defined within the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file for easy customization and management.

## Prerequisites

Before using this pipeline, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Access to a GitLab project with the necessary permissions to create and manage CI/CD pipelines.
- AWS credentials and permissions set up for the GitLab Runner (if using a custom Runner).
- Terraform installed on the GitLab Runner.

## GitLab CI/CD Configuration

The GitLab CI/CD pipeline is defined in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. Customize this file to fit your specific requirements, including Terraform variables, environment settings, and deployment stages.

## Usage

To use this GitLab CI/CD pipeline for AWS EKS deployment, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Configure your AWS credentials either on the GitLab Runner or using GitLab's CI/CD environment variables.

3. Customize the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to match your AWS infrastructure, Terraform configurations, and deployment stages.

4. Push your changes to the repository.

5. Create or schedule a GitLab CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline will execute the defined stages, including Terraform planning and applying.

## Multiple Environments

To deploy to different environments (e.g., test and prod), use GitLab's pipeline schedule variables to specify the target environment. The pipeline will adapt its behavior based on these variables.

## Terraform Backend Configuration

This pipeline utilizes GitLab's HTTP backend for Terraform to securely store the state file. Ensure that you have configured this backend according to your GitLab project settings.
